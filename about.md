## ...the blog
As I like to try different things, I thought I should become better at documenting it, for my own sake.

Static blog built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using the [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) theme.

## ...me
Swede living in Berlin. Engineer, nowadays working as product owner for teams working with machine learning and big data handling.

Still like to get my hands dirty with coding though.

Oh, and my name really is Freddie, so please don't call me Frederic, Fredrik, Freddy or anything else. Thanks in advance!
