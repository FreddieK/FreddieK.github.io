**Length** - One page preferably. Simple design, avoid visual clutter. One column recommended. [A good LaTeX template](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume).

**Objectives** - Career objectives doesn't add much, save for possible cover letter.

**Coursework** - Do add relevant coursework (college and other).

**Skill Ratings** - Doesn't mean much, skip.

**Skill Listing** - Do list technical skills mentioned for the job. The order of the list says a lot, reorder based on job.

**Projects** - Don't add common projects or homework. If adding for example Kaggle competitions, include percentile rank on final leaderboard (above top 10% would be considered good, extra info such as diff to top score and median can give richer understanding). Include links to writeups etc., and focus on real world problems.

**Portfolio** - Online presence on LinkedIn, Kaggle, GitHub, blog etc. is helpful. Ensure for example repositories have descriptions.

**Experience** - Experience is the core. Relevant experience and projects are essential. Tailor the CV to show relevant experience based on the job description.
