I decided to create a static blog where I hopefully might document some of my
various escapades in programming etc.

After testing Pelican and struggling for a bit, I fell back on Jekyll which,
though I'd preferred to work in Python over Ruby, feels much more mature and
is a breeze to work with.

Using the wonderfully beautiful and simple Hyde theme, here in the more modern
[Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) incarnation, which works well
with the 3.* branch of Jekyll.
