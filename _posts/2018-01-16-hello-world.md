I decided to create a static blog where I hopefully might document some of my
various escapades in programming etc.

After testing [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) and struggling for a bit,
I fell back on [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) which, though I'd preferred to work in
Python over Ruby, feels much more mature and is a breeze to work with.

Using the wonderfully beautiful and simple Hyde theme, here in the more modern
[Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) incarnation, which works well
with the 3.* branch of Jekyll.

## Setting up a Jekyll blog as Github page
Installing Jekyll on OSX turned out to be a bit of an issue since the Ruby
version was old. After some fiddling with that, the installation was straight
forward using the official documentation.

The Hyde theme that I was after turned out to not work well either since it
wasn't updated to the 3.* branch of Jekyll. Through [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/)
I found the mentioned Hydeout version that worked better.

Once Jekyll and theme were working correctly, doing the minor initial updates
took no time at all and blogging in markdown is super convenient.

Also, the process of setting it up as a personal Github page takes no time at
all.

All in all, a really nice one-night project where most time ended up being spent
on first trying out Pelican, and then having to troubleshoot an out of date Ruby
installation.
